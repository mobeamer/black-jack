# black-jack
Just a little exercise in writing a pwa app just using plain vanilla javascript and html.

I thought I'd capture the development cycles.

# Iteration 1:
Time: 10 to 12 hours

First iteration. Got the basics working, game doesn't support a lot of common black jack features. But it adds shit up! lol. And keeps track of the score.


# Iteration 2:
Time: 1 hour

Realized that I didn't center the app. Which lead to revamping the cards so that they could be dynamic. Can now add as many cards as I want per hand.
Started to think about splitting stuff...an interesting problem. 
Technically it's like giving a player multiple hands. 
I only coded this up to have one hand per player.
