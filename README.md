# black-jack
Just a little exercise in writing a pwa app just using plain vanilla javascript and html.

I thought I'd capture the development cycles.

# Iteration 1:
Time: 10 to 12 hours

(Removed) http://www.beamerlabs.com/lab/black-jack/v1/

First iteration. Got the basics working, game doesn't support a lot of common black jack features. But it adds shit up! lol. And keeps track of the score.


# Iteration 2:
Time: 1 hour

(Removed) http://www.beamerlabs.com/lab/black-jack/v2/

Realized that I didn't center the app. Which lead to revamping the cards so that they could be dynamic. 

Can now add as many cards as I want per hand.

Started to think about splitting hands...it an interesting coding problem... 

Technically it's like giving a player multiple hands. 

I only coded this up to have one hand per player. Ooops. They call that re-engineering.



# Iteration 3:
Time: 30 min

http://www.beamerlabs.com/lab/black-jack/v3/

Added some padding to the cards

Noticed that you can raise the bet while you see the cards

Raise and lower bet buttons only visible at the end of a hand

You can't hit any more on Blackjack

Black Jack pays automatically

Can double down



# Iteration 4:
Time: 3 hours

(Removed) http://www.beamerlabs.com/lab/black-jack/v4/

Added a player class

Which allowed me to do multiple players (not multi-player)

Things got really wierd with the game state.

Next up, create an API for it

I did not release this to the final site, as it's a little clunky. Stay tuned.

# Iteration 5:
Time: 4 hours

http://www.beamerlabs.com/lab/black-jack/v5/

Recap: 4 hours of wasted time. ugh

Completly wrapped myself around my axel. I got caught up with trying to make multiplayer work. Then I got fascincated with playing multiple hands. Which lead to all kind of codding loops. Finally looked up from call back hell and realized that I was taking on too much. 

Went back to Interation 3 and started over...sometimes you have to take a step back and reset.


# Iteration 6:
Time: 2 hours

http://www.beamerlabs.com/lab/black-jack/v6/

Recap: Figured out how to easily do hand splitting. It's a bit hacky to me but it's working.


# Iteration 7:
Time:  hours

http://www.beamerlabs.com/lab/black-jack/v7/

Recap: (30 min) Clean up time, making sure it "fits" on a mobile device.

Also realized that the deck has to be re-shuffled between hands.
