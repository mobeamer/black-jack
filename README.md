# black-jack
Just a little exercise in writing a pwa app just using plain vanilla javascript and html.

I thought I'd capture the development cycles.

# Iteration 1:
Time: 10 to 12 hours

First iteration. Got the basics working, game doesn't support a lot of common black jack features. But it adds shit up! lol
